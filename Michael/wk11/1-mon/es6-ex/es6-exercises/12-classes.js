// Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two-dimensional space.
// A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor.

// It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns the sum
// of the two points, that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties
// of the two original points, and whose y is the sum of their y properties.

// Your code here
console.log(new Point(1, 2).plus(new Point(2, 1)))
// â†’ Point{x: 3, y: 3}
