# dancing cat

## fun with setInterval and CSS positioning!

you will need to read up about 2 functions: `setInterval` and `clearInterval` and css `position: absolute`. 

- Download the starter index.html file and move the javascript code into a separate JS file!
- Add an event listener to the start button, so that the cat starts moving across the screen when its clicked.
- Add an event listener to the stop button, so that the cat stops moving when clicked.
- Add an event listener to the speed button, so that the cat moves faster when it's clicked. 
- When the cat reaches the edge of the screen, have her walk back to the start. Repeat forever.
- Make sure your code works even when the screen is resized (you will need to find the window width with Javascript.
- BONUS: When the cat reaches half way, have her stop and replace the image with a dancing cat gif for a moment, then resume.

Tip: trying calling the `startCatWalk()` function in the console
